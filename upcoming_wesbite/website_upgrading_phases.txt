Questions Before Implementation:
FAB Social Links - Which social platforms do you want to include?

Google Scholar ✓
ResearchGate ✓
ORCID ✓
GitHub - Do you have a GitHub profile URL?
LinkedIn - Do you have a LinkedIn profile URL?
Twitter/X?
Resume Download - Do you have:

A PDF version of your resume?
Where should it link? (resume.html or a PDF file?)
Collaboration Network - Which detail level?

Simple: Just show top 5-10 collaborators
Detailed: Show all co-authors from all papers
Interactive: Clickable nodes that filter publications
Citation Data - How should we handle citation counts?

Static: Use the counts we already have (43 total)
Manual Update: You update periodically
API Integration: Try to fetch from Google Scholar (complex)
Timeline Interactivity:

Click to jump to publication details?
Hover tooltips with full info?
Filter publications by clicking timeline nodes?
Let me know your preferences, and I'll start implementing! Should I proceed with default sensible choices, or would you like to specify these details first?

FAB Social Links - Which social platforms do you want to include? Google Scholar ✓ ORCID ✓ GitHub - Do you have a GitHub profile URL? Yes, https://github.com/Ajaykhanna LinkedIn - Do you have a LinkedIn profile URL? https://www.linkedin.com/in/ajay-khanna/ Twitter/X? - Yes, https://x.com/samdig

Resume Download - Do you have: A PDF version of your resume? Yes, I have but I'll provide the link later Where should it link? (resume.html or a PDF file?): A PDF File

Collaboration Network - Which detail level? Interactive: Clickable nodes that filter publications

Citation Data - How should we handle citation counts? Manual Update: You update periodically

Timeline Interactivity: Filter publications by clicking timeline nodes?

Is it possible to have a world map of collaboration showing countries and states I have collaborators. Ideally, I as big dot hover at the top of the world map and arrows going from me to countries and states where I have collaborators. When a mouse arrow is brought to the country/states, it will show the collaborators name and publication titles. The map can be flat but needs to be interactive.
